computer representation of the problem : 
    - want to build a list of pentominos : list of lists of tuples (pentominos(pentomino(cell coordinates or cell object)))
        - codeforces robot factory problem https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1600/J
    - can then check for cell node consistency : cell can't contain num greater than len(pentomino) in wich it images
    - can check for arc consistency : around the cell, in the same pentomino (the cell is in only 1)

    bref ; need only 1)list of pentominos (made with cell objects); 2) list of cell objects : (contains sides (open vs closed), num, coordinates)
