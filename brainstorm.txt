next : 
need to perspectiveWarp the image to get it square
    finding the corners (human does it)
need to extract just the grid
    can do it with math
need to draw **all** the lines (might want the user to input max width, then numsquares)
    math works

extracting the numbers : check how cs50 did it, maybe no need to retrain, just import a model
    check each case, assign a number value to those who actually have a number in them

extracting thick lines 
    check cv2 docs for line thinning algorithm, then extract remaining lines. check where they are in the grid, and assign which cells are their neighbours OR
        check a box for each cell (0101 thing)
        
computer representation of the problem : 
    - from case images computer can determine, for one case, number + which sides are thick (TODO)
    - loop over every cell img. for each, extract relevant info into Cell object and append to cells list
    - want to build a list of pentominos : list of lists of tuples (pentominos(pentomino(cell coordinates or cell object)))
        - codeforces robot factory problem https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1600/J
    - can then check for cell node consistency : cell can't contain num greater than len(pentomino) in wich it images
    - can check for arc consistency : around the cell, in the same pentomino (the cell is in only 1)

    bref ; need only 1)list of pentominos ; 2) list of cell objects : (contains sides (open vs closed), num, coordinates)


    images on which I can test : 
    0_4 : is 4
    0_9 is 4
    0_15 is 3
    0_19 is 3
    7_5 is 4
    ###recognition doesnt work without cropping
    ### doesn't really work after either....
