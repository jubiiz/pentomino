next : 
need to perspectiveWarp the image to get it square
    finding the corners (human does it)
need to extract just the grid
    can do it with math
need to draw **all** the lines (might want the user to input max width, then numsquares)
    math works

extracting the numbers : check how cs50 did it, maybe no need to retrain, just import a model
    check each case, assign a number value to those who actually have a number in them

extracting thick lines 
    check cv2 docs for line thinning algorithm, then extract remaining lines. check where they are in the grid, and assign which cells are their neighbours OR
        check a box for each cell (0101 thing)
